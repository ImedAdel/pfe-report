Software is either slow, hard, or ugly.
And sometimes all three.
Nonetheless, since the introduction of the modern computer, software has taken the world by storm.
And it quickly became an essential component of every business since it paved the way for higher productivity and more automation, and therefore, increased profits.

Nearly forty years \parencite{noauthor_macintosh_2010} have passed since the launch of the Apple Macintosh---one of the first commercially successful \parencite{polsson_chronology_2009} mass-produced personal computers featuring a graphical user interface.
Yet, software is still as inaccessible and inadequate for most users as ever.
Perhaps the best example for such inaccessibility is the fact that this document is being produced using \LaTeX---a fractured software system that requires a plethora of tools to be installed for the sake of producing a legible and aesthetically pleasing document.

Along with the domination of personal computers and software companies in the world, another technology was on the rise---the internet. Since the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s, the internet has reshaped our lives.
Be it entertainment, communication, education, or work, the internet is the easiest and most powerful medium.
Therefore, it is no surprise that most software companies switched to \acrfull{saas}, that is hosted software served through the medium of the internet \cite{december_2019_what_nodate}.
The world has been seeing a continuous shift to remote work since the internet boom in the early 2000s.

The recent global pandemic instantly boosted the number of remote workers to unprecedented levels.

On top of that, businesses have been gradually moving away from brick-and-mortar stores to online software-managed ones.

Furthermore, client-side web apps and no-code web apps and websites have experienced a surge in the number of users.

These factors uncovered a gap in the niche of easy-to-use collaborative data and content management software.
